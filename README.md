# neural_net

Based on the tutorial at Based on tutorial: https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/
I wanted to make a neural net that let the user input how many hidden layers they wanted to include. This example uses simple made-up data, and outputs the error to see how it decreases over iterations with different numbers of layers.
